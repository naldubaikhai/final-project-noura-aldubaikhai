            <h1 style="color:gray">Dimensions of Wellness: Financial Wellness</h1>
            <p style="color:gray">Financial wellness is an intricate balance of the mental, spiritual and physical
                aspects of money. This unique
                combination is an ideal to strive towards in our dealings with money. Financial wellness is having an
                understanding of your financial situation and taking care of it in such a way that you are prepared for
                financial changes. Maintaining that balance consists of being comfortable with where your money comes
                from and where it is going. Take the quiz below to see how close you are to achieving financial health.

                                they are licensed and educated to review your whole financial picture and help you meet

                                Action Step: How to get a financial education without going back to school? Look to
                                financial magazines to begin your
                                education. Pick up a book or two to guide you in your understanding of financial
                                matters. There are many out there on
                                the shelves. Pick up one that appeals to you. Then, attend a financial workshop or two.
                                Local business groups or
                                continuing education centers offer them at convenient times and at little or no expense.
                                Be sure to attend and learn, not
                                buy anything. As you are in the learning phase, you need to gather information before
                                taking action.</td>

                                putting in the extra time and effort to
                                improve things. An ounce of prevention is worth half the cure.
                                Action Step: How do you start now putting in the extra time and effort into your
                                finances? First, set aside time to review
                                what income you have and how you spend it. This may involve pulling together financial
                                records or starting from scratch
                                tracking the information. Next, pull out your bank statements, credit card statements
                                and retirement and investment
                                accounts. On one sheet of paper, summarize how much you have and where it is. Finally,
                                do this all on a semi-annual
                                basis.</td>

                            <td>Messed Up - Get help immediately! You can not do it on your own. Just think of all that

                                stress around money that someday could be gone, if you act now! Find your financial
                                balance by establishing a wellness
                                plan by making a concentrated and dedicated effort. It is the way to stability (and
                                sanity!)
                                Action Step: Where to get the help you need? First, you may ask friends how they do it –
                                if you are comfortable talking to
                                them about money. Second, consider talking to a therapist or other professional about
                                why it is you have resistance to
                                facing up to money and its place in your life. Then, continue moving up the scale above
                                until you have a better
                                understanding of your money.</td>

                            <td>35 to 40 Points</td>

                                slowly, it may be overwhelming to
                                deal with reality.)
                                Action Step: If you are willing to put in some work, there is hope for you. First, Pray.
                                I am not kidding. This is a big task
                                and to make it happen, you need the Big Guns. Second, think about your money and how it
                                got that way. Just in an
                                objective sense, no beating yourself up or creating a crisis of past wrongs. Write it
                                down and acknowledge it. Next, spend
                                twenty minutes a day with your finances. Start with simple tasks – cleaning your wallet
                                and counting the money there;
                                collecting the loose change scattered in your house, car, and pockets and putting it in
                                one place. When you are
                                comfortable with these tasks, move slowly up the scale.</td>
