<li>Women on the birth control pill and who smoke have a greater risk of having a stroke or heart attack.</li>
<li>Women who smoke are 3 times more likely to be infertile</li>

<h2 style="color:#009999">Benefits of quitting smoking:</h2>

<ul style="color:gray;font-size:25px">
<li>Within 8 hours, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal, and the oxygen level in the blood increases to normal..</li> 
<li>Within 72 hours, the bronchial tubes relax, making breathing easier and lung capacity increases.</li>
<li>Within 1-9 months, coughing, sinus congestion, fatigue and shortness of breath decrease; the cilia regrow increasing the body's ability to handle mucous, 
clean the lungs and reduce infection; and the body's overall energy level increases.</li>
<li>Within 5 years, the lung cancer death rate for average, one pack a day smokers decreases by almost half (from 137per 100,000 to 72 per 100,000).</li>
<li>Within 10 years, the lung cancer death rate for average smokers drops to almost that of non-smokers; precancerous cells are replaced; and the risk of other cancers 
- such as those of the mouth, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney and pancreas, decreases.</li>

</ul>

<h2 style="color:#009999">What will make quitting easier?</h2>

<ul style="color:gray;font-size:25px">
<li>Tell your family and friends that you are going to quit.</li> 
<li>Drink gallons of water every day.</li>
<li> Ask for their assistance and support. They must understand that you find it difficult to be around them when they are smoking, 
so you may appear to avoid contact for a few months.</li>
<li>Have non-fattening snack foods around: Carrots, celery sticks, gum, apples.</li>
<li>Smokers and Ex-smokers should eat a diet rich in beta carotene found in carrots, spinach, broccoli.</li>
 <li>Don't have cigarettes around at all, and don't bum from friends.</li>
<li>Collect a jar of butts and when you are tempted, take a whiff.</li>
 <li>Take one day at a time. Congratulate yourself every day and celebrate once a week, but no cigarette as a reward.</li>
<li>After a week off, you will probably try to convince yourself that you have this addiction licked and you can have just one...</li>
<li>Join a support group at the Lung Association.</li>
 <li>"But I have tried to quit and I can't!" Stick with it! Many successful quitters will tell you that it can take many attempts before 
 you are smoke free. Don't give up, instead try again.</li>
